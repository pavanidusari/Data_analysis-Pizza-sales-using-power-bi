# Data_analysis-Pizza-sales-using-power-bi


In this data analysis and visualization project, we explore the sales data of a pizza store using a combination of SQL and Power BI. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how data analysis can be effectively performed by leveraging both SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization and insights generation. Through this project, we showcase the synergy between these two powerful tools in extracting valuable information from a real-world dataset.

Objective
Data Extraction and Preparation: Access and clean pizza store sales data from a structured database using SQL queries.
Data Analysis using SQL: Utilize SQL to aggregate sales, calculate trends, and segment customer orders, uncovering insights.
Data Transformation and Modeling: Load SQL-transformed data into Power BI, shape it further, and establish relationships for visualization.
Data Visualization with Power BI: Create dynamic visualizations using Power BI's tools to showcase sales trends, top products, and category distribution.
Insights Generation: Extract valuable insights from visualizations, including seasonality patterns, popular categories, and customer behaviors.
Steps in Project
Step 1: Importing raw data in MySQL server

Create a new schema in MySQL Workbench
Open Table Data Import Wizard
Select the csv file as raw data and import
Step 2: Writing SQL queries according to client or business requirement

Write query to get the desired output
Answer the questions according to KPI's requirement using sql
Step 3: Creating report from MySQL server

Create a documentation of the results
This report will help for cross checking the results from power bi with the results from MySQL
Step 4: Connecting MySQL server with Power BI

Open power bi and import data from MySQL database
You will need to install MySQL connector
Step 5: Data cleaning using power query tool

Step 6: Data processing in Power BI

Step 7: Data Visualization in Power BI
